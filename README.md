## Overview


## Instructions

To run the model, first clone the repository to your local machine, or download all necessary files individually.

Next, in your browser, navigate to Google Drive. Ensure you are ready to use Google Colaboratory. To check if you have Colaboratory prepared on your Google Drive account, click the `+ New` button at the top left of the screen, and then `More` at the bottom of the dropdown menu. If Google Colaboratory does not appear, you will need to connect it to your account by clicking the `+ Connect more apps` button. You will be directed to Google Workspace Marketplace, from which you can install Google Colaboratory. After setting it up, return to the Drive homepage.

Using the leftmost sidebar, navigate to `My Drive`. Create a new folder titled `income_prediction`. The code uses specific, hard-coded file paths to retrieve the data, so it is crucial that this folder name appears exactly as it does here, and that it is stored in `My Drive`. If you care to change the path in which you store the materials for this model, make sure to update the file paths in the code accordingly.

From the `Notebooks` folder in the repository, drag the files titled `first_model.ipynb`, `tuned_model.ipynb`, and `tuned_model_2.ipynb` to the `income_prediction` folder in your Google Drive.

From the `Resources` folder in the repository, drag the file titled `cleaned_df.csv` to the `income_prediction` folder in your Google Drive.

Once the `.ipynb` files and the `.csv` files are loaded into your `income_prediction` folder, right click on `first_model.ipynb`. Hover over `Open with`, and then click on `Google Colaboratory`. 

You should now be able to run the model by clicking `Runtime` on the top menu bar, and then `Run all`.

You may be prompted to allow Google Colaboratory to mount to your Google Drive account. Allow this to happen by following the on-screen prompts.

The code will run. At the bottom of the screen, you will see the modelâ€™s accuracy and loss percentages.

The same procedure can be followed for the tuned models by opening the `tuned_model.ipynb` and `tuned_model_2.ipynb` with Google Colaboratory.
